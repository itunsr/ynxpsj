	61、得不到回报的付出，要懂得适可而止，否则，打扰了别人伤了自己。
　　Z是本地人，他的家就在学校附近。十年寒窗，从终点回到起点，绝非他之所愿，所以他很不安份，像所有血气方刚的年轻人一样的不安分。当初报考师范是为了跳农们，当他回到乡下教书后，他后悔了，他认为自己是能考上大学的。他很快成为全乡人注目的焦点，他的衣着打扮，说话举止让那些整天在地里劳作的农民很看不顺眼，骂他是假洋鬼子。他为这地方创造了多项第一：第一个穿风衣，第一个打领带，第一个往头发上洒香水。校长对他也很不感冒，尽管他的书教的不错。校长看出了他的野心，他除了上课，空余时间总是拿着高中课本复习，他想参加高考。按照当时的规定，教师至少要工作三年以上才可以报考高等院校。一个刚刚工作的教师，就想跑，校长能不急吗？他到底背着学校参加了那年的高考，成绩不错，被一所大学录取了，可通知书被教育局扣住了。Z跑去找领导理论，不但没要回通知书，反被领导狠狠地批了一顿。他一气之下，失踪了好几天，最终学校派人在峨眉山找到他。他站在舍身崖上坐了一个晚上。人们都以为他去那里寻短见，那个时候有许多失恋的年轻人去那里自杀。回到学校后，他剃了一个光头，课堂上让学生笑个不停。
希望在春天的诗梦里，满树桃花盈芬芳，点点芳蕊轻盈露，桃花笺赋诗柔，桃花呢喃语轻柔，思纤婉约赋卷浓。一池墨香，青词赋卷，清风拂案，月光朦胧，珠帘轻卷，帘动幽香。
Praise the ode to life, for the ant so much a grand national impulse.
The surface of the sun as ants issued a golden name, of the common soldier like wuxi play, hard hard work well this work.
Ant Wang Weiai for junior gave their lives, and who can love sacrifice their lives, regardless of the results.
The queen in power head, mother is the leader of ants, run with ants resolute.
People view the matriarchal guide man is worse than not.
Ant system of the human life, has a boundless boundless mystery, tiny not humble, perseverance is not weak, in combination with not messy.
Ants can't write my history, however, not sure is inprogress giant.
...
Flying fox looked at her figure, the eight other Buddha ket, heart not hovering in my ears.
The white horse looked round him away, couldn't help longitudinal sound sad HSS, don't understand why they have not turned to the old owner.
Love is an eternal theme of mankind, including erotic love, in the hold of a martial arts world of love is not turn evil reason, the protagonist is always stubborn, obsession, is a stubborn man, also is fragile, knights errant's leaf ErNian, li mo sorrow, round really, etc. In such, multi-line evil eventually by the scourge, but conscience as to make the reader with grief, because nature is these people are not very vicious, but is in the fork of the road down through thousands of bullet carelessly.
Knights errant so, of course, put forward some "if Yu Aizhe, worry-free nor", is not a simple negation of "love" existence and value, not abstinence and withered zen, he was between lust alert those addicted to the world, there is nothing wrong with persistent, but too stubborn, become paranoid, is harm for people with yourself.
So, what are out of those fans, free and easy a bit floating in the world.
Compassion yuantong become a desolation and an eternal theme of works, often appear shaolin, the characters and the plot of monks, all the characters have a could have the enlightenment of the road, a road to liberation trouble, it is a pity because too delusion, too, and finally make everything or isolated, or dust.
His hands bloody and dirty ChengKun unexpectedly also has a touching romance;
Bear guilt is a even though sometimes it became one of the gate of chastity, destroyed a marriage and family of sinners;
Xiao Feng, thank sun reputation but also because the karma for stop killing.....................
Is a little less compassion, and so are unable to continue down the ripeness.
Is a bit paranoid, a little more taste heart free, even just a bit, between good and evil are minority determines the conclusion - key.
Characters in the book, whether monks are no longer important, whether true Buddha also no longer eternal, tian long ba bu buddhist lingo metaphor characters but also be struggling with the timeliness of bitter differences, especially about the concept of perfect, knights errant is the conclusion: there is no perfect man.
Rescue Xiao Feng, make fox blunt not perfect;
Draco looked at the one light of the master is not perfect;
Even the order pack hidden in shaolin big brother had also once committed by the villain of the piece, sexual, abandon his wife and children in;
However, this some not hamper their higher layer of Buddha, this state is "close to god, the magic to construct."
Test and improve state, it is a care for the reality of the dynamic state of Buddhism, is also a test of the eternal.
Is constantly put down some, cheer up some, a bit of tact.
Is the constant diligence.
With moral has been relegated to a secondary position, in the history of real space and life in the central, reduction and easy enlightenment is the most important.
In "tian long ba bu", so was the silent monk, the old monk was to clean up the sutra depository and multi-line unjust dove "instant enlightenment wisdom in well, made their own bodhi;
In "giant" fierce old qiu towering deathbed confession heart and desire for ying gu forgiveness, finally completed a final program, put down the butcher's knife, site become Buddha is also the reason of its good thoughts, thus making ying gu with old urchin, one light solved the real debt...
"Big" is the final outcome, is also the goal of the Buddha, great compassion, great, realize or reunion, great saphenous.
Of course, also including real, completely in the sense of "big man".
From knights errant story, make the person remember a word "big", "big" make life not so sad, no longer so often, no longer so big.
Won't importune big, also no longer panic in big fall...
Spend for charming eyes letter hand twist to Buddhism and Confucianism from the reality of the Confucian care into the Taoist quiet light, finally beyond ordinary human enlightenment, the Buddha nature which is not only a philosophy of ascension process gradually, at the same time also is Buddhism and Confucianism in the Chinese culture as the foundation of the trinity of Oriental wisdom.
Is a read billions, and one hundred idle away one's, however, can change to ten thousand itself, also can put out the hustle and bustle of the bodhi.
Perhaps, this is the most charming place knights errant.
For such was close to the xuan Oriental wisdom, he almost can't change too much, will not change too much so suddenly pushed for the reader to understand.
In the handheld device maker e-ten slew a dragon to record "in zhang mowgli sun siddhi practice hold river's lake by actually very like the piao zhuo the daodejing: soft constant memory, just fold, hence to win strong;
Recognizing the sing like dreams, fame and wealth as a lot...
He since he is strong, I demonstrated the horizontal suction...
What is more, he borrowed the mouth sing of zoroastrianism heroic ideal world: burn I mutilated, raging flame.
Life just says?
Death is also why?
Flow, I worry more.
We can perceive on Buddhism give even about Taoism glides gracefully any fear of heaven and earth, both Confucian universal concern.
Seems to be sad, but there is quiet, again scrutinize it's fine as silk loving wide as heaven and earth, numerous and Jane, Jane and complex mixed construction also secretly in the metaphor has again and again, there are no, life two, two gave birth to three, until the boundless universe, all the world...
Ebb and flow, causal, corresponding, the philosophy of the variables also construct the knights errant wuxia world in the world, from the clutch accumulation and dispersion of the characters, sorrow, hate, joy even in the middle of a recruit a type and character of itself.
Once people are knights errant wrote so many novels, each one with hao many of the characters and the plot twists and turns, fascinating, make this one, don't know how to move the brain to conceive.
Perhaps the warrior is with these highly Oriental wisdom of philosophy to life two, two gave birth to three, ebb and flow of long, strong and weak weak to mimic take pains mixed, and building the jin yong's martial arts world.
And do this, is the need of deep and profound life of learning, is the need for careful and central taste, is need extraordinary talent and inspiration of whole, and that a suitable age, has a little bit of even a very small chance.
Is also a - Oriental wisdom.
Also can have friends comment on these works, comments are not same attitude. I appreciate that kind of straight gas and the way of management, in a period of knights errant writing, business occupies certain proportion, but he can be common for elegant, refined into the vulgar, write novels popular novels so refined, so fascinating, spread the Chinese culture so wide, we also hard on what?
This is more than a decade later, I put down the book of knights errant, pick up some books in the mood.
Time is gone, people always want to experience the feeling - - way journey, can be natural.
Age of the chivalrous farther and farther away from us, they fade into the light on the top of the rock, or threatened sunsets.
Looks but I know, as long as I'm willing to, still can see the peach blossom into a matrix, the sea blow xiao huang, day day remained absolutely affection the bottom looking forward to seeing a little dragon female lover, that drink got wasted make fox blunt, there is still standing in the eaves of the Confucianism, the jiangnan water - knights errant.
